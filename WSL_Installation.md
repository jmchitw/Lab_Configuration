Great question, James—and one that definitely depends on your goals. Since you're deep into Bash scripting, VM provisioning, and infrastructure automation, the “preferred” WSL distro isn’t just about popularity—it’s about how well it integrates with your workflow.

Here’s a breakdown of top contenders and how they might fit your style:

---

### 🏆 Most Popular & Versatile: **Ubuntu (20.04 or 22.04)**
- **Why it shines**: Huge community, great package support, and most tutorials assume Ubuntu.
- **For you**: Excellent for scripting, automation, and Markdown tooling. Works well with Ansible, Docker, and cloud SDKs.
- **Bonus**: Easy to install via `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`.

---

### 🧰 Sysadmin-Friendly: **Debian**
- **Why it shines**: Minimal, stable, and close to Ubuntu without the extra fluff.
- **For you**: If you want a leaner base for custom automation scripts and tighter control over packages.
- **Bonus**: Great for building reproducible environments from scratch.

---

### 🛠️ Red Hat Ecosystem: **Fedora or AlmaLinux**
- **Why it shines**: Ideal if you're prepping for RHCSA or working in RHEL-based environments.
- **For you**: Perfect for testing your Bash-driven VM cloning and inventory scripts in a Red Hat-compatible setup.
- **Bonus**: AlmaLinux is a solid CentOS replacement with long-term support.

---

### 🧪 Cutting Edge: **Arch Linux**
- **Why it shines**: Rolling release, bleeding-edge packages, and full control.
- **For you**: If you want to experiment with the latest tools and build everything from the ground up.
- **Caveat**: More hands-on maintenance required.

---

### 🧼 Minimalist: **Alpine Linux**
- **Why it shines**: Tiny footprint, fast startup, musl libc.
- **For you**: Great for container-style scripting or ultra-lightweight automation tasks.
- **Caveat**: Might require extra effort for compatibility with some tools.

---

If you're building modular, auditable scripts and want reproducibility across labs and production, I'd lean toward **Ubuntu for general use** and **AlmaLinux or Fedora** for RHCSA prep and Red Hat workflows. Want to test-drive multiple? WSL makes it easy to install and run several distros side-by-side.

Want help setting up a dual-distro WSL environment or scripting a provisioning routine across them? I’m game.
Ah, the classic WSL uninstall curveball. What likely happened is this:

### 🧩 What `wsl --uninstall` Actually Does
The command `wsl --uninstall` **removes the WSL feature itself**, not just a specific distro. It disables WSL from Windows, but **does not automatically remove installed distributions** like Ubuntu or Fedora. So when you reinstalled WSL and added Fedora, Ubuntu was still hanging out in the background—untouched and ready to boot.

---

### 🧠 Why Ubuntu Still Shows Up
- **WSL doesn’t auto-remove distros** unless you explicitly uninstall them.
- Ubuntu is often the default distro installed with `wsl --install`, unless you specify another one.
- If you previously installed Ubuntu, it remains registered in your WSL environment until you run:
  ```bash
  wsl --unregister Ubuntu
  ```
  That nukes it from orbit—removes the filesystem and unregisters it from WSL.

### 🧪 How to Check What’s Installed
Run:
```bash
wsl --list --verbose
wsl -l -v
```
This will show all installed distros, their states, and which one is set as default.

---

### 🧼 Clean Up or Keep Both?
If you want to remove Ubuntu:
```bash
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
```

If you want to keep both and switch between them in VS Code:
- Use the **WSL extension** in VS Code.
- Click the green corner icon > “New WSL Window” > choose your distro.

Let me know if you want help scripting a distro setup routine or creating a Markdown doc to track your WSL environments. You’ve got the perfect mindset for modular provisioning—WSL just needs a bit of taming.
No harm at all—in fact, keeping both can be a strategic advantage. Here’s why:

---

### ✅ Benefits of Keeping Multiple WSL Distros

- **Environment Isolation**: You can test scripts or automation routines in different ecosystems (e.g., Fedora for RHCSA prep, Ubuntu for general tooling).
- **Package Diversity**: Some tools or dependencies behave differently across distros—having both lets you compare and adapt.
- **Backup & Redundancy**: If one distro breaks or gets misconfigured, you’ve got a fallback.
- **Cross-Distro Scripting**: You can even script across distros using `wsl -d <DistroName>` to run commands in parallel or validate portability.

---

### ⚠️ Minor Considerations

- **Disk Space**: Each distro has its own filesystem, so they’ll take up space—especially if you install lots of packages.
- **Default Confusion**: VS Code or terminal might default to one distro unless you explicitly choose. Easy to fix, but worth noting.
- **Update Management**: You’ll need to keep both distros updated separately (`sudo apt update` vs `sudo dnf update`, for example).

### 🧠 Pro Tip for You, James

Since you’re building modular, auditable scripts, having both Ubuntu and Fedora lets you validate your logic across Debian-based and Red Hat-based systems. That’s gold for portability and documentation. You could even build a Markdown cheat sheet comparing command syntax, package managers, and quirks between the two.

Want help drafting that cheat sheet or scripting a cross-distro inventory check? I’m all in.
Smart move, James. With both Fedora and Ubuntu in your WSL toolkit, you’ve basically got a dual-lab setup at your fingertips—perfect for testing cross-distro compatibility, refining your RHCSA prep, and building cheat sheets that actually reflect real-world variance.

If you ever want to:
- 🔄 Script distro-specific provisioning routines
- 📋 Compare package managers (`dnf` vs `apt`) in a Markdown doc
- 🧪 Validate Bash logic across environments
- 🗂️ Track inventory or audit logs per distro

I’m here to help you modularize it all. You’ve got the architecture mindset—now you’ve got the playground to match.
